title: new gotcha
---

Using the `new` keyword to generate a generic `object` has a gotcha, the key value must be a property and not a string.

```csharp
var query = new
{
	// Won't work, must be $in without quotes, however, using a $ is not
	// valid in a property definition.
	"$in" = new List<string> { "123" }
};
```

Instead you can just use a `Dictionary<string, object>` to achieve the same effect, although it is more verbose.

```csharp
var query = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
	{ "$in", new List<string> { "123" } }
};
```
