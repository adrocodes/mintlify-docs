title: Check if two dates are the same day
description: Need to compare two dates and check if it is the same day? Here is how you can do it.
---

```ts
function datesAreTheSameDay(date1: Date, date2: Date): boolean {
  return date1.toDateString() === date2.toDateString();
}
```

`toDateString()` produces something like "Mon Aug 09 2023", so we can compare the two strings to see if they are the same day.

<Info>This doesn't check if the dates are the same, only that it is the same day, month & year</Info>
