title: Search indexing - Failed to index
description: In some cases, the indexing might fail to index the site. In cases like these you may need to trigger a manual reindexing to get it to work.
---

```shell
yarn add datocms-client
```

```js reindex.js
const SiteClient = require('datocms-client').SiteClient
const client = new SiteClient("{search-api-key}")
const buildId = '{Building Triggers > Production (id in URL)}'

client.buildTriggers.reindex(buildId)
	.then(() => console.log("Done!"))
	.catch((err) => console.error(err))
```

You can add this to your project and run it as a node script. (`node reindex.js`) Run it and hope it outputs `Done!`, it might take a few seconds (or minutes) depending on the site size.

Once completed, hope back into Dato and check the Build Activity Log. You should see a successful site crawl message. Trigger a manual redeployment to ensure it'll reindex properly.
